This repository contains the source files used to create [my
website](https://unia.github.io) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The theme used
is an adaptation of the [Cactus theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/cactus/).

To setup, run `setup.sh`. This is required only once. Henceforth, to deploy the
website, run `deploy.sh`. See [this blog
post](https://unia.github.io/blog/deploying-hugo-on-personal-gh-pages/index.html)
for more information.
